= OptimalBot

OptimalBot (Opti) is a bot for Vying Games.  It's based on the work of Magnus
Javerberg who worked out the math for what he believes is the optimal strategy
for the game Footsteps.  The code for the implementation was written by Eric K
Idema.  For more on this see:

  http://vying.org/games/footsteps
  http://vying.org/user/OptimalBot


= License

OptimalBot is licensed under the same license as Ruby itself.


= Installation

OptimalBot is available as a gem.  (Note:  it depends on the vying gem)

  gem install optimalbot --source http://vying.org

Or, you can get the source directly from Subversion:

  svn co svn://code.vying.org/optimalbot/trunk optimalbot


= Dependencies

Opti is dependent on the vying gem.  But it's also dependent on either
the sqlite-ruby gem or the sqlite3-ruby gem.  You should use the gem that
matches whatever version of Sqlite you have installed on your system.


= Development

See the following website for development related issues:

  http://vying.org/dev/public


= Usage

The vying gem and commandline tool should pick up OptimalBot automatically.


= SQL

The optimal solution data is stored in an Sqlite database file (footsteps.db
for Sqlite2 and footsteps3.db for Sqlite3).  An sql dump of the database is
provided in footsteps.sql[link:footsteps.sql].
